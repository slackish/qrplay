Introduction
============

Welcome to slackage. Let me give you (and me) a vague
description of what I'm thinking.  This language is attempting
to be Harvard architecture, very machine language based
language. Some of the things here will not likely be implemented
before DefCon 22, which is my goal.



Components 
==========

 * Variables/Data Types
 * Operands


Variables/Data Types
====================

Most thing stored in registers.  I'm thinking about having a heap bit of some sort and being able to call things to store into the heap.  




Operands
========

 * Add
 * Subtract
 * Multiply
 * Divide
 * Modulo
 * Bitwise And
 * Bitwise Or

 
API
===

Programs WILL be written with certain API's in mind.
